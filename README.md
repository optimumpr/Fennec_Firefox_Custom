# Fennec_Firefox_Custom
Customized build of the always latest Firefox for Android

This is in no way a guide on how to compile Fennec-Firefox for Android or setup your build environment.  If you need that, head for Mozilla mobile wiki and learn. This is simply my build configuration, which you may use for your own build.

This is Firefox with disabled telemetry, crash reporter, maintenance service, updater, tests, stats and google related binaries
